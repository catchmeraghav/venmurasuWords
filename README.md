# venmurasuWords
my objective is to create a repo of all words in the novel series Venmurasu (tamil novel version of Mahabaratha)

The venmurasu novel series started 1 Jan 2014 by writer Jeyamohan, wit one episode a day.
The Vishnupuram Group had a release function 6 Dec 2014 with 4 initial novels in Chennai. 

Before the function, Nanjil Nadan, another contemprory writer of tamil mentioned in a video about super set of words in any language and the its subsets becoming public's vocabulary. He also mentioed the same in the function.

This project is an lame attempt to try and see if all the words in Venmurasu can be captured.
like, for example...
{ 'A' : { 'N' : { 'T' : {'word' :'ANT', 
                         'meaning' : 'a six legged small insect',
                         'episodes' : ['2017/12/25'], # date(s) when this word appeared in Venmurasu
                        }
                  'D' : {'word' :'AND', 
                         'meaning' : 'a conjuction',
                         'episodes' : ['2017/12/25', '2017/12/24', '2017/12/23'], # date(s) when this word appeared in Venmurasu
                        }
                },
         },
         {
          'P' : { 'P' : {'L' : 'E' : {}}}
        },
 'B' : {}
}

The above to be achieved in tamil.
I am using Durus here, an object DB, to do this

This should be further extended to search for individual words in ta.wikitionary.com and if meaning is not found add them
Which is something mentioned by writer Jeyamohan, in several of the discussions.

Once this is completed, this can be extended to other works of Jeyamohan and may be any digitally available tamil work.
